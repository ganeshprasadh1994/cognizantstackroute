  <h2>Basic Info</h2>
  <p>
    Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian cricketer and captain, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen
    of all time.[4] He took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the
    age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the
    only player to have scored one hundred international centuries,  the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International,
    the holder of the record for the number of runs in both ODI  and Test cricket, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs
    in international cricket.

    Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997,
    India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and
    second highest civilian awards.[11] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced
    the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[12][13] He is the youngest recipient to date and
    the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[14][15] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year
    at the ICC awards.[16] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[17]
    He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain
    by the Indian Air Force.[18] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia.[19][20]
